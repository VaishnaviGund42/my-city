        Pandharpur is a holy town located in Solapur district of Maharashtra, on
        the banks of the Chandrabhaga River, also known as the Bhima River. It
        is one of the most important pilgrimage centers in Maharashtra and is
        famously called the spiritual capital of the state. The town is best
        known for the Vitthal Rukmini Temple, dedicated to Lord Vitthal (a form
        of Lord Krishna or Vishnu) and Goddess Rukmini. Every year, lakhs of
        devotees, known as Warkaris, visit Pandharpur during the grand
        pilgrimage called the Pandharpur Wari. This tradition is especially
        celebrated during Ashadhi Ekadashi in June–July and Kartiki Ekadashi in
        October–November, when devotees walk for hundreds of kilometers from
        towns like Alandi and Dehu to reach Pandharpur, chanting the name of
        Lord Vitthal and singing abhangas composed by saints. The Chandrabhaga
        River, flowing in a crescent moon shape, adds to the town’s sacredness,
        as pilgrims take a holy dip in it before visiting the temple. Pandharpur
        also holds immense cultural and spiritual significance because saints
        like Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Tukaram, Sant Eknath, and Sant Namdev spread
        the message of devotion and equality here, strengthening the Bhakti
        movement in Maharashtra.
