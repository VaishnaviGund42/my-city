    <div><h1 style="text-align: center;">Pandharpur: The Abode of Lord Vitthal</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: 300px; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6; margin:0 50px; text-align: justify;">Pandharpur is a holy town located in Solapur district of Maharashtra, on the banks of the Chandrabhaga River, also known as the Bhima River. It is one of the most important pilgrimage centers in Maharashtra and is famously called the spiritual capital of the state. The town is best known for the Vitthal Rukmini Temple, dedicated to Lord Vitthal (a form of Lord Krishna or Vishnu) and Goddess Rukmini. Every year, lakhs of devotees, known as Warkaris, visit Pandharpur during the grand pilgrimage called the Pandharpur Wari. This tradition is especially celebrated during Ashadhi Ekadashi in June–July and Kartiki Ekadashi in October–November, when devotees walk for hundreds of kilometers from towns like Alandi and Dehu to reach Pandharpur, chanting the name of Lord Vitthal and singing abhangas composed by saints.

The Chandrabhaga River, flowing in a crescent moon shape, adds to the town’s sacredness, as pilgrims take a holy dip in it before visiting the temple. Pandharpur also holds immense cultural and spiritual significance because saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Tukaram, Sant Eknath, and Sant Namdev spread the message of devotion and equality here, strengthening the Bhakti movement in Maharashtra. Today, Pandharpur remains not only a place of religious importance but also a symbol of unity, culture, and deep-rooted devotion in Maharashtra.</p>
